### Added
- Codex CLI support via `ccsc codex` subcommand
- Per-provider CODEX_HOME isolation with separate auth.json and config.toml

### Added
- Auto-check for npm updates on startup and display upgrade notification when new version is available

## [1.0.9] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed
- Restore stdin raw mode before spawning child process to prevent CLI from appearing frozen
- Switch from interactive shell (`-i`) to login shell (`-l`) to prevent stdin contention with Claude Code

## [1.0.8] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- Resolve claude binary via clean login shell to avoid version manager PATH pollution

## [1.0.5] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- `--cli <name>` option to specify CLI tool (overrides `CC_CLI_PATH` env var)
